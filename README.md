Scritp Mainfile.m has and example on how to use the coded.

function topsissimBM.m is main function call for the method.

function simLPBon.m computes Bonferroni mean based similarity between alternatives.

function Bonmean.m computes Bonferroni mean.

function normalization2.m normalizes data into unit interval.
